# Fullstack Project | DevelopsToday - Diego Teileche

This is a Fullstack project that consists of two parts: the frontend and the backend. Each part runs independently but they interact with each other. Below are the instructions to start both servers.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Installation
